# Basic-SmartWatch-Ontology
Part of learning from the MOOC - Practical Knowledge Modelling: Ontology Development 101.

Taking inspiration from the example of BallpointPen ontology used in the course, I developed a basic ontology for SmartWatch. The major entities included are the components, characteristics, types, and make of smartwatches.
